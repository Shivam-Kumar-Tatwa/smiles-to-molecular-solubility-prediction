# smiles-to-molecular-solubility-prediction

**This is a Web-App that uses the Machine Learning algorithm to predict the Molecular Solubility of any Drug molecule and also identifies their corresponding descriptor values.**

Description:- This app predicts the Solubility (LogS) values of molecules! Data obtained from the John S. Delaney. ESOL:â€‰ Estimating Aqueous Solubility Directly from Molecular Structure. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2004, 44, 3, 1000-1005.

Note:- SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a chemical notation that allows a user to represent a chemical structure in a way that can be used by the computer. SMILES is an easily learned and flexible notation.

Technology Used:-

1. Machine Learning:- Only Linear Regression is used in this project.

2. Rdkit:- RDKit is a collection of cheminformatics and machine-learning software written in C++ and Python. https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit
